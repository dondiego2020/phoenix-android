# Phoenix Client Configuration Example
# This configuration file defines how the Phoenix client operates.
# The client connects to the Phoenix server and opens multiple local listeners.

# remote_addr: The address of the Phoenix server.
# The client connects to the server using HTTP/2 Cleartext (h2c) for optimal performance and stealth.
# h2c allows multiple inbound connections (SOCKS5, SSH, etc.) to share a single TCP connection.
# Example: "example.com:8080"
remote_addr = "127.0.0.1:8080"

# [[inbounds]]: Defines a list of local listeners.
# Each inbound listener opens a local port and tunnels traffic of a specific protocol.

# Example 1: Local SOCKS5 Proxy
[[inbounds]]
# protocol: The type of traffic to handle.
# Supported values: "socks5", "shadowsocks", "ssh"
protocol = "socks5"
# local_addr: The local address and port to bind on.
local_addr = "127.0.0.1:1080"
# enable_udp: Allow SOCKS5 UDP Associate.
enable_udp = true
# auth: Optional. For Shadowsocks, this would be the password/method. For SSH, key path.
# auth = ""

# Example 2: Local SSH Tunnel Endpoint
[[inbounds]]
protocol = "ssh"
local_addr = "127.0.0.1:2022"
# auth: Not strictly required for simple forwarding, but can be used for client-side auth.
auth = "/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa"

# Example 3: Shadowsocks Proxy (Disabled)
# [[inbounds]]
# protocol = "shadowsocks"
# local_addr = "127.0.0.1:8388"
# auth = "aes-256-gcm:my-secret-password"
