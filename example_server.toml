# Phoenix Server Configuration Example
# This configuration file controls the behavior of the Phoenix server.

# listen_addr: The TCP address and port the server will bind to.
# This port accepts incoming connections from Phoenix clients over HTTP/2 Cleartext (h2c).
# We use h2c because it supports multiplexing (multiple streams over one TCP connection)
# and mimics standard HTTP/2 traffic patterns, making it effective for censorship circumvention
# while avoiding the overhead of double-TLS if used behind a TLS terminator (like Nginx/Cloudflare).
# Default: ":8080"
listen_addr = ":8080"

# [security]: This section defines which tunneling protocols are permitted.
# By default, all protocols are disabled for security. You must explicitly enable them.
[security]
# enable_socks5: Allow clients to tunnel SOCKS5 traffic.
# If set to simply `true`, any authenticated client can use SOCKS5.
enable_socks5 = true

# enable_udp: Allow SOCKS5 UDP Associate (for UDP tunneling).
enable_udp = true

# enable_shadowsocks: Allow clients to tunnel Shadowsocks traffic.
# Requires additional configuration for keys if enabled.
enable_shadowsocks = false

# enable_ssh: Allow clients to tunnel SSH traffic.
# This does NOT make the Phoenix server an SSH server. 
# It only allows tunneling of SSH connections to other destinations.
enable_ssh = false
